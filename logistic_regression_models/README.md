# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a logistic regression model to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive or negative based on their word content. The code uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and visualization to explore and model the sentiment expressed in tweets.

## Overview

The script processes a dataset of positive and negative tweets, extracts features, and trains a logistic regression model to classify sentiments. It visualizes the data points and the decision boundary of the model, along with arrows indicating the direction of positive and negative sentiments.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:

- `nltk`: For natural language processing and accessing Twitter sample data.
- `pandas`: For handling data in DataFrame format.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib numpy
